Title: CannonGame.java
Description: I found this Cannon Game applet on the java.sun.com site. It was old and had many deprecated methods so I turned it into an application updated it so that it had no more deprecated methods and added an extended canvas class. This code creates a cannon that shoots at a target and increments the score when the target is hit. Users can adjust the velocity, wind velocity, gravity, and angle of the shot. This was good for me to learn how to include gravity in a pinball game program that I'm developing for my Software Engineering class which I'll post when it's finished.
