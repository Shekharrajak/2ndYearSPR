Using Adobe dreamweaver very simple method to create a Image slider using jQuery : 
(I am prefering adobe dreamweaver editor for writting code.)
	1. Open and create project give name any ,i am giving name as img slider.
	2.should have one folder ,i am creating this in desktop named slider and save project there with photos
	you want to be showed in the image slider.
	3.open any browser and go to jQuery.com and click on download button and click on "download the compressed production jQuery2.03".
	4.you will get a page with lots of code .save page in the folder slider.
	5.now go to jQuery.malsup.com  , now go to cycle plugin  ,download the cycle plugin , click on cycle plugin,
	6.save this page in slider folder.
	7.open dreamweaver and insert the script in your html code(at head ) : jQuery library function and jQuery cycle plugin.
	8.create a div name slider  ; now insert images in that div using insert tool from the folder slider in desktop.
	9. now write this code inside head :  
	
	<script type ="text/javascript">
	$('#slider')cycle({})
	</script>
	10.save and run in browser.
	
	Hey now you done.
	
This is very simple way to create image slider but this is not have much controls and functions . now below I am showing how to create pager and 
next ,previous page buttons,image description and name  on the images.
	
	1.I am creating here these follows id : 
			a)hero
					b)pager
					c)next
					d)prev
					e)slider
							i)div class = slider-item;
							ii)h2 class = caption;
							iii)h3 class= desc;
							iv)img  which you want to slide.
							copy and paste these i to iv step for other img.
							(copy paste these code ,and giveimage source)
							
		b,c,d,e are inside the hero id .
		
	2. make css code inside style : 
			2.1) for hero id:
					width:
					height:
					display:
					position:
					margin:
					border:
					border-radius:
					-webkit-box-shadow:
		give these according to your convenience , my code can be seen 
		in the pictures attached.
		2.2) for slider id :
					width:
					height:
					display:
					position:
	
		2.3)for next and prev id :
				you can use dreamweaver functionalities also to insert images and other designing options.
		
		
		2.4)go to the jQuery part and add some code there:
				->fx:   'scrollHorz'
				(this fx gives very beautiful slide to images)
				->timeout : 2000
				(this timeout option give delay between two slides )
				-> next : "#next"
				-> prev : "#prev"
				(these two activate the functions of left and right arrow)
				->pager : "# pager"
				->pause: 1
		
	3)caption fixing :
		css part 
			.caption{
				width:
				height:
				line-height:
				text-align:
				display:
				position:
				background-color:
				color:
				border-top-right-radius:
				border-bottom-right-radius:
			}
		copy these properity for desc class.add {top : 60px} (for me here) to this.
	4) css for pager id 
			width:
			display:
			position:
			z-index:99;
			text-align:
			bottom:20px;(top make it at bottom above 20 px)
	
	5)#pager a {
		width:
		height:
		display:inline;
		position:
		background-color:
		border:
		margin:
		border-radius:
		font-size:.0em;(tiniest size)
		color:transparent;
	}	
	6)#pager a.activeSlide{
	background-color:white;
	
	
	
	}
you can add a lot of things inside that and give it more and more beautiful look to it.

but here it is beautiful enough image slide has been created.To make it more clear I have attached some screenshot for the convenience of learner
to understand the code better.

thankyou...:)
